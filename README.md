Hello you!

You probably asking yourself right now how to use this program.
Well, Here some instructions:


1. To add your new meetings in your week, simply go to the file with the correct day (..\Files\Days) and add the information (time, link) - You can 
leave all the other information (meeting id, passcode) blank. *if the meeting requires a password add it in the passcode too*
*This is the class format in the day file:*
Time: Example - 11:05,,Passcode if needed: Example - 101010,Zoom Link: Example - https://us04web.zoom.us/

2. Make sure all the zoom settings are changed (when you run the program its will show you how to change and what to change).

3. Do not touch the "registered.txt", if you do, the program won't work correctly.

4. Download all the libraries needed (look at Requirments).

5. If you want the script to run automaticlly every day when you turn on the computer to the following steps:
	A. Create a shortcut of the exe file.
	B. open the run window (Winkey + R).
	C. Write: shell:startup
	D. When the window opens move the shortcut you created in A to the folder.

5. Have fun :)
